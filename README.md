## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a Spotify Music Recommender system that provides personalized song recommendations based on user preferences. The application uses machine learning techniques to analyze audio features and suggest similar songs that match your musical taste! 🎶

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Song-based recommendations**: Get recommendations based on a song you like
- 🎚️ **Feature-based recommendations**: Customize recommendations by adjusting audio features
- 📊 **Genre analysis**: Explore audio characteristics of different music genres
- 💻 **Interactive web interface**: User-friendly design for easy navigation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Python 🐍
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn 📈
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means clustering, Nearest Neighbors algorithm 🤖
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn 📊
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🌐

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Processing**: The system loads and preprocesses a Spotify dataset 📝
2. **Feature Engineering**: Audio features are weighted and scaled for better recommendations ⚖️
3. **Clustering**: Songs are grouped into clusters based on similar characteristics 🔄
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Two recommendation methods:
   - 🎵 Song-based: Finds similar songs in the same cluster
   - 🎛️ Feature-based: Uses nearest neighbors algorithm to match user preferences

## 📥 Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository 📋
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` 🌐

## 🎮 Usage
